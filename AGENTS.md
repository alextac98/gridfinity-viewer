1. Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.
2. Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.
3. Touch only what you must. Clean up your own mess.
4. Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

## Repo Organization

This is one Next.js app that hosts multiple Gridfinity tools. Keep it as a single deployable app unless there is a concrete need for separate packages or deployments.

- `src/app/` is only for Next.js route entrypoints, layout, metadata, and global CSS. Keep route files thin.
- `src/shell/` owns the product shell: sidebar navigation, app selection, theme state, and the app registry.
- `src/shell/appRegistry.ts` is the source of truth for which apps are available in the shell.
- `src/apps/<app-name>/` owns each tool implementation. Put app-specific components, helpers, state, and types inside that app folder.
- `src/apps/types.ts` contains shared app registration types.
- `src/components/ui/` is for shared, app-neutral UI primitives only after more than one app needs them.
- `src/lib/gridfinity/` is for shared Gridfinity domain logic such as constants, units, geometry helpers, and future OpenSCAD parameter builders.

When adding or changing a tool, prefer working inside its app folder and only touch `src/shell/appRegistry.ts` when registering or renaming apps. Do not put generator-specific behavior in the shell.
